## Notes
* Code Editor – VS Code (strongly encouraged, but OK to also use emacs or vim).
Plugins
* Configurations
* How to create a plugin (interesting topic)
* A good thing to talk about – why it could be useful to also know vim and emacs (SSH).
* Configuring your environment is great to learn in college but no one teaches it.
* Don’t be scared of those configuration things.
* VS Code has this thing called “Language services” that helps you do do stuff.
