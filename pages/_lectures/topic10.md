### Podcasts
* For design thinking and general inspiration, [99% Invisible](http://99percentinvisible.org/) can't be passed up. Many designers love it, saying that it's one of the highlights of their week.
* If you like short podcasts, [Immutable](https://spec.fm/podcasts/immutable) is good. It's very tangible - they talk about specific things, not huge ideas. There's also [Developer Tea](https://spec.fm/podcasts/developer-tea) which is also pretty short, and has solid content for all types of people interested in development.
* If you're willing to deal with some longer stuff, consider checking out [Design Details](https://spec.fm/podcasts/design-details) (which is a lot of designers talking about how they got into the industry).
