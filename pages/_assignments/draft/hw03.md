## Your Tasks
Before you begin, please download the Homework 3 starter files.

### 1. Selector Practice: CSS Diners (4pts)
Complete the first 14 steps of <a href="https://flukeout.github.io/" target="_blank">CSS Diner</a>. When you're done, take a screenshot showing you completed all of the levels. Your screenshot should have a green checkmark next to each level (like the one below but with checkmarks).

Note that Quiz 1 will expect you to know all of the selectors, so make sure that you understand and review each of the 14 steps to study for Quiz 1.

### 2. Practice Assigning CSS Rules Using Selectors (6pts)

For Task #2, you will style the `index.html` file -- by editing `styles.css` -- so that it looks like <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dqZdvTELzxYBOoTtsxxa30IEvw_MAKT5/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">this video</a> (also pictured below).

<div class="continuous">
    <img src="/fall2023/assets/images/homework/hw03/exercise02a.png" /> 
    <img src="/fall2023/assets/images/homework/hw03/exercise02b.png" />
</div>

To do this, open the `exercise02` folder and complete the tasks below. You may only edit the stylesheet (`styles.css`). **Do not edit anything inside `index.html`.** Note that there are many ways to come up with a correct answer.


{:.checkbox-list}
* **[1pt]** Give the main section some margin on the left and right sides so that it looks like the image shown above (try `15vw`).
* **[1pt]** Set the background color of the first, third, and fifth cards to `#EEEEEE`.
* **[1pt]** Set the background color of the second, fourth, and sixth cards to `#BCE5D6`.
* **[1pt]** Make the images inside the first, third, and fifth card circular.
* **[1pt]** Set the font family of all of the text to `'Courier New'`. Remember that fonts cascade, so you could just set it in one place (but there are many other ways to do it as well).
* **[1pt]** Set the font weight of the **first paragraph** and the **paragraph inside the footer** to bold. The paragraphs inside the cards should **NOT** be bold.


### 3. Practice Importing a Google Font (5pts)
Open `exercise03` and use CSS to assign a custom Google Font font to the `h1` and `h2` tags. 

* Note: the example shown below is using the "Sacramento" font (imported from <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Sacramento" target="_blank">Google Fonts</a>), but you may use any font that you want.

Feel free to Google "How to use a Google Font in CSS" if you need help, or consult one or more of the links provided below:

Before you submit:
* Ensure that only the `h1` and `h2` tags have been assigned the font (and not all of the text).

## What to Submit
**Please Read Carefully:** To submit Homework 3, please paste the following links into the Moodle under the Homework 3 submission section:

1. A link to your **homepage** (from Tutorial 3) on GitHub pages, which should link to your `hw03` assignment (and previous tutorials and classwork you have done).
2. A link to your GitHub **code repository** (where your code files are stored).
    
    
**IMPORTANT**: Make sure that your CSS Diner screenshot is saved in your `hw03/exercise01` folder before you commit / send your files to GitHub.
