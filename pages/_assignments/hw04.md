## Overview
The goal of this week's homework is to give you practice with CSS Grid and Flexbox. To do this, you will complete 7 exercises, which you will have time to work on during Tutorial 5 this week. 

Homework 4 can be completed individually or in pairs. If you decide to work in pairs, you can discuss solutions and share code with your partner. That said, both people should still complete all of the exercises, commit their own files to GitHub, and and submit to the Moodle separately. If you collaborated with someone, you will just make a note of who you worked with in the comments section.

## Your Tasks
<a href="/fall2023/course-files/homework/hw04.zip" class="nu-button">HW04 Starter Files <i class="fas fa-download"></i></a>

Download the `hw04.zip` file, unzip it and move the unzipped `hw04` folder into the `csci185/homework` folder.


### 1. Flexbox Froggy
Please complete **levels 1-13** of <a href="https://flexboxfroggy.com/" target="_blank">Flexbox Froggy</a> and take a screenshot of your completed levels (like the screenshot shown below, but with the first thirteen levels completed). When you're done, save your screenshot in the `hw04/01-flexbox-froggy` folder. 
* You can earn **2 points extra credit** if you complete all 24 levels.

### 2. Center-align elements within a container

Open `02-flex` and create the layout shown below by editing the CSS file. You should not need to edit the HTML.

<img src="/fall2023/assets/images/homework/hw04/exercise02.gif" />

Please ensure that the following criteria are met:

{:.compact}
* The height of each `section` should be the same as the height of the browser window.
* The content inside of each `section` tag should be centered horizontally and vertically.
* Each `section` should have a different background color.
* The content in each `section` should be stacked vertically

### 3. Create a Navigation Bar
Open `03-navbar`, and try to make the following layout using flex. The navigation bar should also be anchored to the top so when you scroll, the nav bar stays fixed.

<img class="frame large" src="/fall2023/assets/images/homework/hw04/exercise03.png" />

Hints:

{:.compact}
* Both the `nav` and `ul` elements will need to be put into flex mode.
* Use the Chrome inspector to adjust the alignment properties.
* To turn the bullets off, set the `list-style-type` property to `none`.
* To create a fixed menu, see <a href="https://codepen.io/vanwars/pen/LYBdyzJ?editors=0100" target="_blank">this code sample</a>: 


### 4. CSS Grid Garden
Please complete **levels 1-15** of <a href="https://cssgridgarden.com/" target="_blank">CSS Grid Garden</a> and take a screenshot of your completed levels (like the screenshot shown below, but with the first thirteen levels completed). 
* Please save your screenshot in the `hw04/04-css-grid-garden` folder. 
* You can earn **2 points extra credit** if you complete all 28 levels.

<img class="frame medium" src="/fall2023/assets/images/homework/hw04/exercise04.png" />

### 5. Create this layout

Open `05-grid`, and try to make the following layout using CSS Grid. You should not need to modify the HTML file. Note that the gridlines are just for demonstration, but they wonâ€™t actually be visible.

<img class="small" src="/fall2023/assets/images/homework/hw04/exercise05.png" />

**Note:** You do NOT have to center the text inside of each section unless you want to.

### 6. Create the Taco Temple layout

Open `06-tacotemple`, and try to make the following layout using CSS Grid. You should only have to edit the CSS file. 

<img class="large" src="/fall2023/assets/images/homework/hw04/tacotemple01.png" />

**A few hints:**
The `main` container is a grid with two columns -- no rows specified). See grid lines: 

<img class="large" src="/fall2023/assets/images/homework/hw04/tacotemple02.png" />

The `section` container is also a grid with two columns. See grid lines: 

<img class="small" src="/fall2023/assets/images/homework/hw04/tacotemple03.png" />

### 7. Create the following mobile / responsive layout
During [Lecture 8](../lectures/topic06), we discussed how to use CSS Grid to make the three layouts shown below. For your final task, please implement this layout (or repurpose the work you already did in class). Use media queries to implement the tablet and mobile layouts. The recommended media queries are:

```css

/* Tablet */
@media screen and (max-width: 800px) {
    /* Your CSS here */

}

/* Phone */
@media screen and (max-width: 500px) {
    /* Your CSS here */

}
```

#### Desktop Layout
<img class="large frame" src="/fall2023/assets/images/homework/hw04/exercise07a.png" />

#### Tablet Layout
<img class="medium frame" src="/fall2023/assets/images/homework/hw04/exercise07b.png" /> 

#### Mobile Layout
<img class="small frame" src="/fall2023/assets/images/homework/hw04/exercise07c.png" />
