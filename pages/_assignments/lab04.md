## Learning Goals

### JavaScript
* Introduce await / async + server-side data
* Writing tests to work w/async function calls

### Software Construction
* Continue helping students think about right level of abstraction for API design

## Ideas for a "Toy Context"
* Make a JavaScript wrapper for querying and displaying artists, tracks, and albums.
    * Part I: No server queries. Just make the widgets to display the information + unit tests.
    * **Part II**: Do the fetch calls and then display the widget + unit & integration tests.
