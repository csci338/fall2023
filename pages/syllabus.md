## Course Materials & Resources

### Software
As this is a programming course, you will be using the free software programs listed below. This software will take about 3GB of space to install. Installing and configuring programming software can be a hassle, but it is part of the process of developing your working computing knowledge. I will help you.

## Course Policies

### General
* No food, no drinks, and no water inside the classroom. If you need to eat or drink, please step outside the classroom (away from the computers) to do so.
* Be respectful of others during classroom discussions and presentations.
* We may have the occasional remote class session.

### COVID Policies
* **Masking.** Currently, there is no masking mandate at UNCA with the exception of healthcare settings and University shuttles. Please respect individuals’ personal decisions to either wear or not wear a mask in any given circumstance.
    * ***Note:*** I may require masks in my office. I may also request that students voluntarily continue wearing masks in class, with the understanding that masking cannot be required.
* **Social distancing.** There is no official policy regarding social distancing in the classroom. Please be sensitive to the fact that everyone’s comfort level will vary. Whenever possible, please keep several feet between yourself and a classmate. If a classmate requests more space, please do so kindly and without judgment or question. 
* **Illness policy.** Please stay home if you are ill, and email me -- I will let you know how you can catch up / participate remotely.

### Academic Honesty
In the past, there have been a few unfortunate instances in which students have presented work other than their own. Here are some guidelines to help you understand what is and is not appropriate"

#### Labs
Helping other students with their in-class labs  is allowed and encouraged, but each student should type their own solution unless otherwise specified in the lab instructions.

#### Homework and Project Work
You are allowed and encouraged to discuss general approaches to solving problems, but all work you submit must be your own. Working “together” and presenting variants of the same file is not acceptable. Here are some specific guidelines to make sure you don’t cross the line:
* Do not exchange programs or program fragments in any form – on paper, via e-mail, or by other means.
* While working with other students, it is perfectly acceptable to ‘look’ at each other’s code (perhaps while helping someone to debug), but you should NEVER be scribing (typing or writing) your own work while looking at someone else’s (on a computer screen, paper, whiteboard, etc.).
* Uploading materials from this course to websites that sell such content to students is prohibited by UNCA’s academic integrity policies, and may also put you at risk for violating copyright policies in UNCA’s Student Conduct Code.

Contact Sarah Van Wart if you have any questions about what is appropriate.

#### Using the Broader Web for Code and Ideas
In this class, I encourage you to explore the broader web for tutorials, code samples, new coding techniques, libraries, etc. After all, learning how to build websites is all about studying existing websites and how the work! That said, you must *acknowledge all sources contributing to your work.*  If you receive any assistance from any source (Internet, peer, social media, etc.), please describe your source and that source’s contribution(s). If you have any questions about this, please don't hesitate to contact me.

Students violating the academic honesty policy on a test or exam will receive a grade of "F" in the course. Students violating the academic honesty policy on an assignment other than a test or exam will receive a grade of 0 on that assignment for the first offense, and will receive a grade of "F" in the course for the second offense. This will apply to all students involved in the violation, including both the source student and the copying student. It is your responsibility to ensure that your work is not used by other students.

All cases of academic dishonesty will be reported to the Assistant Provost.


### Class Cancellation Policy
If a class meeting is canceled or due dates are moved due to inclement weather or any other reason, I will inform you via campus email (ending with unca.edu).



## University Policies
### Acknowledgement of the COVID-19 Pandemic
As a community in this time of uncertainty, we seek to uphold and embody our ideals of compassion, resilience, understanding, and flexibility for each other.  With that understanding, here are a list of course policies active for this semester:
1. We all are expected to abide by our institution's [community expectations](https://coronavirus.unca.edu/return-to-campus/community-expectations/). If you are in a public space you are expected to wash your hands and maintain social distance from others. 
2. COVID-19 vaccines are strongly encouraged for all students, faculty, and staff; surveillance testing is also available on campus.
3. If you become ill: 
    * Do not physically attend any classes.
    * If emergency, dial 911. For non-emergency medical help contact [UNC Asheville Health and Counseling Center](https://healthandcounseling.unca.edu/) at (828) 251-6520, Monday-Friday 8:00am - 4:30pm. After hours call MAHEC at (828)257-4740.
    * Reach out to your instructor as you are able.

### Office of Academic Accessibility 
UNC-Asheville values the diversity of our student body as a strength and a critical component of our dynamic community. Students with disabilities or temporary injuries/conditions may require accommodations due to barriers in the structure of facilities, course design, technology used for curricular purposes, or other campus resources. Students who experience a barrier to full access to this class should let the professor know, and/or make an appointment to meet with the Office of Academic Accessibility as soon as possible. To make an appointment, call 828.232.5050; email academicaccess@unca.edu; visit [https://oaa.unca.edu/](https://oaa.unca.edu/) and click on "Schedule an Appointment"; or drop by the Academic Accessibility Office, room 008 in the One Stop suite (lower level of Ramsey Library). Learn more about the process of registering, and the services available through the Office of Academic Accessibility here: [https://oaa.unca.edu/](https://oaa.unca.edu/)

While students may disclose disability at any point in the semester, students who receive Letters of Accommodation are strongly encouraged to request, obtain and present these to their professors as early in the semester as possible so that accommodations can be made in a timely manner. It is the student’s responsibility to follow this process each semester.

### Promoting Gender Equity, Addressing Sexual Misconduct
UNC Asheville is dedicated to cultivating and maintaining a safe, respectful, and inclusive environment, free from harassment and discrimination. We strive to ensure that all have equal access to the educational and employment opportunities the University provides. If you or someone you know has been affected by sexual misconduct, including sexual or gender-based harassment, sexual assault, dating or domestic violence, or stalking, please know that help and support are available. UNC Asheville strongly encourages all members of the community to take action, seek support, and report incidents of sexual harassment to the Title IX Office. You may contact the Title IX Office or Heather Lindkvist, the Title IX Coordinator, directly at 828.232.5658 or at titleix@unca.edu. Learn more by visiting [titleix.unca.edu](https://titleix.unca.edu).

As a faculty member, I am a “responsible employee” and private resource. This means that if you share any information or discuss an incident with me regarding sexual or gender-based harassment, I must disclose this information to the Title IX Coordinator. Our goal is to ensure you are aware of the range of options available to you and have access to the resources you may need. 

If you wish to speak with a confidential resource, contact University Health and Counseling Services at 828.251.6520. Off-campus confidential resources include Our Voice (24-Hour Hotline at 828.255.7576) and HelpMate (24-Hour Hotline at 828.254.0516).

### Academic Indicators
Faculty at UNC Asheville are required to use the university's Academic Indicators system. The purpose of this system is to communicate with students about their progress in courses. Academic Indicators can reflect that a student’s performance is satisfactory at the time it is submitted, or they can indicate concerns (e.g., academic difficulty, attendance problems, or other concerns). Professors use this system because they are invested in student success and want to encourage open conversations about how students can improve their performance. When a faculty member submits an indicator that expresses a concern, the student receives an email from Academic Advising notifying them of the indicator and subsequent registration hold on their account. To clear the hold, the student must complete an online Response Form included in the alert e-mail. 

The student’s responses will be shared with the instructor and advising staff. If a student receives three or more indicators that show problems, they will need to meet with an advisor by scheduling an appointment using the online appointment service at [advising.unca.edu](https://advising.unca.edu/) and select ‘Academic Alert Appointment’ as the type of appointment. The professor may also request to meet with the student to discuss the indicator.  It is in the student's best interest to complete the process quickly, as students who do so are more likely to earn credit for the course. Failure to complete the process means the student won't be able to register for the next semester's classes until they have submitted the required form and completed any requested meeting requirements. Questions about the indicator system can be directed to Anne Marie Roberts (amrober1@unca.edu) in the [Academic Success Center](https://www.unca.edu/academics/academic-success/).

### Mental Health Support
As a student, you may experience a range of challenges that can interfere with learning, such as stressful life events, experiences of anxiety and/or depression, self-harm, substance use, and/or unusual difficulty with ordinary life activities. The increased stress of school can also make existing mental health struggles more difficult to manage. Support is available and treatment can help. Learn more about the confidential mental health services UNC Asheville provides to support student success at [https://www.unca.edu/life/health-counseling/](https://www.unca.edu/life/health-counseling/)
