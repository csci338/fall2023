In Lab 6, you built a client-side web app using "Vanilla JavaScript." In this lab, you will be building the same client using React. 

## 1. Background Readings and Resources
* TBD

## 2. Set-up

{:.blockquote-no-margin}
> ### Tips before you begin
> In this version of the task list app, you are using React and Parcel. React is a client-side framework that will ultimately need to be transpiled to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Parcel is a tool that helps you transpile / bundle your code everytime you save. Given this:
> * We recommend that you disable the Auto Save for this lab, because you don't want to activate your bundler on every keystroke (which may be invalid JavaScript...which could trigger transpiler errors that aren't really errors).
> * Conversely, if you think the transpiler got confused and you want to trigger the build process again, just add a blank line to your code and save (all saves trigger the build process).

### 2.1. Create a lab07-your-username branch
After completing [Lab 6](lab06), you will create a new branch from your existing `lab06-your-username` branch (from within your `class-exercises-fall2023` repository) as follows:

```sh
git status  # make sure you've committed all of your files
git branch  # verify that you're on the lab06-your-username branch
git checkout -b lab07-your-username  # should create a new branch based on your lab05 branch
git branch  # verify that you're on your new branch
```

When you're done, please make the following modifications to your code:

### 2.2. Modify existing files and add some new ones
In order to run React, we're going use two different Docker images -- one for Python + Fast API, and one for Node.js. To do this, please open VS Code and make the following changes to your code files in your version of the `lab05` folder:

#### 2.2.1. Dockerfile
Replace the contents of your current Dockerfile (within the `app` directory) with this:

```sh
# Image for Node.js and React:
from node:lts
COPY ./src/ui /ui
WORKDIR /ui
RUN npm run build

# Image for Python / Fast API
from python:3.11
COPY ./src /app
COPY --from=0 /ui/dist /app/ui/dist
WORKDIR /app
RUN pip install poetry
RUN poetry install
CMD ["poetry", "run", "uvicorn", "server:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0"]
```

Note that there are now two images: one for the client that uses Node (top), and one for the server that uses Python (bottom).

#### 2.2.2. compose.yaml
Also in the `app` directory -- on the same level as your Docker file -- create a new file called `compose.yaml` that contains the following:

```sh
services:
  server:
    build:
      context: .
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    volumes:
      - ./src:/app
    depends_on:
      ui:
       condition: service_healthy
    entrypoint: poetry run uvicorn server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --reload

  ui:
    image: node:lts
    # user: "${UID}:${GID}"
    ports:
      - "1234:1234"
    volumes:
      - ./src/ui:/app
    working_dir: /app
    healthcheck:
      test: "ls dist"
      timeout: 30s
      interval: 10s
    entrypoint: npm run watch
```

The Docker compose file's job is to provide instructions regarding how each container should be built from its respective image.

#### 2.2.3. package.json
Inside of `src/ui`, create a new file called `package.json` with the following code:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "lint": "html-validate *.html && stylelint **/*.css && eslint *.js",
    "build": "npm install && parcel build index.html",
    "watch": "npm install && parcel watch index.html -no-hmr",
    "format": "prettier -w */**.js"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "eslint": "^8.51.0",
    "eslint-plugin-react": "^7.33.2",
    "html-validate": "^8.6.0",
    "parcel": "^2.10.0",
    "prettier": "^3.0.3",
    "process": "^0.11.10",
    "stylelint": "^15.11.0",
    "stylelint-config-standard": "^34.0.0"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^18.2.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.2.0"
  }
}
```

#### 2.2.4. Update the .gitignore file
Since we will now be introducing React, some new folders will get created (`node_modules`, `.parcel-cache`, and `dist`). Because these directories contain code that has been generated by third-party modules, they are typically ***excluded*** from version control using the `.gitignore` file. Therefore, please open your `.gitignore` file (at the root of your `app`) and add the following lines:

```sh
node_modules
.parcel-cache
dist
```

### 2.3. Build New Docker Images & Container
You are now ready to build your Docker containers using the Docker compose command, which you will issue from within your `app` directory (on the command line):

```sh
docker compose up
``` 

Unlike before, the shell processes runs in the foreground (which is actually a good thing because you can debug!). When the installation and build scripts finish, you should see an output line that says something like:

```sh
Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

Your server is now ready to be tested. Please verify that your old "vanilla" client is running: <a href="http://localhost:8000/index.html" target="_blank">http://localhost:8000/index.html</a>

{:.blockquote-no-margin}
> #### Two Docker Images, Two Containers
> Notice that in your Docker Dashboard, there are two images (one for node and one for python) and two containers. Pretty neat! This means that if you need to issue any node commands, hop onto the `task-list-labs-ui` container. Similarly, if you need to issue any python commands, hop onto `task-list-labs-server` container. Reminder of how to get to the shell prompt for each:

```sh
docker container ls -a
docker exec -it <container_id> sh
```


### 2.4. Setup React to work with Parcel
Finally, now that your new Docker instance is configured, you're ready to rewrite your code using react. Please make the following changes:

#### 2.4.1. Server-Side Updates
In `server.py`, change your mount point to `ui/dist` (which is the directory where your bundled client-side files will live). This line should be at the very bottom of `server.py`:

```py
# app.mount("/", StaticFiles(directory="ui", html=True), name="ui")
app.mount("/", StaticFiles(directory="ui/dist", html=True), name="ui")
```

By changing this path, you're telling Fast API that all of your client-side files will come from the bundled version of your files created by Parcel (which happens to be `ui/dist`).

#### 2.4.2. Client-Side File Updates

##### index.html
Rename your current `index.html` file (in `ui`) to `index-vanilla.html`. Then create a new, blank, `index.html` file in the same folder. When you're done, add the following code to `index.html`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./css/tasks.css">
    <script type="module" src="./js/main.js" defer></script>
    <title>React Client</title>
</head>

<body>
    <div id="app"></div>
</body>

</html>
```

##### main.js
Rename your current `main.js` file (in `ui/js`) to `main-vanilla.js`. Then create a new, blank, `main.js` file in the same folder. When you're done, add the following code to `main.js`:


```js
import { React, useState } from "react";
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";

function App() {
    return (
        <main>
            <section>
                <h2>Task List</h2>
                <div className="task-list"></div>
            </section>
            <form className="add-task">Form goes here</form>
        </main>
    );
}

function main() {
    const root = createRoot(document.getElementById("app"));
    root.render(<App />);
}

window.onload = main;
```

You are now ready to build some React components.

## 3. Creating Components
React -- and client-side frameworks in general -- offer many convenient features including:
* A way to encapsulate smaller snippets of functionality into components
* A set of design patterns that other developers also learn
* A set of convenience functions for managing common tasks

For our React version of our "Task Client", we're going to break up our functionality into 4 components:

* [Form](#form)
* [Task](#task)
* [TaskList](#task-list)
* [App](#app)

### 3.1. Create Component Stubs

{:#form}
#### 3.1.1. Form.js

<img class="img-sm" src="../assets/images/lab07/form.jpg" alt="Screenshot of a form" />

Create a new component called `Form.js` inside of the `ui/js` directory. Paste the code shown below into `Form.js`, which returns a JSX representation of the form. Note that the form submit functionality hasn't been implemented. We'll do that later:

```jsx
import { React, useState } from "react";
export default function Form() {

    return (
        <form className="add-task" method="post">
            <h2>Add New Task</h2>
            <label htmlFor="name">Name:</label>
            <input
                type="text"
                placeholder="Task name"
            />
            <label htmlFor="description">Description:</label>
            <input
                type="text"
                placeholder="Task description"
            />
            <button>Add</button>
        </form>
    );
}
```

{:#task}
#### 3.1.2. Task.js

<img class="img-sm" src="../assets/images/lab07/task.png" alt="Screenshot of a task" />

Create a new component called `Task.js` inside of the `ui/js` directory.  Paste the code shown below into `Form.js`, which returns a JSX representation of a task with hardcoded data. We'll add more logic to this file later.

```jsx
import { React } from "react";

export default function Task() {

    return (
        <div className="item">
            <strong>Dishes</strong>
            <p>Do the dishes.</p>
            <button>Delete</button>
        </div>
    );
}
```

{:#task-list}
#### 3.1.3. TaskList.js

<img class="img-sm" src="../assets/images/lab07/task-list.png" alt="Screenshot of a task list component" />

Create a new component called `TaskList.js` inside of the `ui/js` directory.  Paste the code shown below into `TaskList.js`, which returns a JSX representation of a list of tasks. We'll add more logic to this file later.

```jsx
import { React } from "react";

export default function TaskList({ taskList, getTasks }) {

    return (
        <div className="task-list">Tasks go here</div>
    );
}
```

{:#app}
#### 3.1.4. App.js

<img class="img-sm" src="../assets/images/lab07/app.png" alt="Screenshot of a app component" />

```jsx
import { React, useState } from "react";

export default function App() {

    return (
        <main>
            <section>
                <h2>Task List</h2>
                <div>Some tasks</div>
            </section>
            <form>Some form</form>
        </main>
    );
}
```

#### 3.1.5. main.js
In your new `main.js` file, paste the following code:

```jsx
import { React } from "react";
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
import App from "./App";

function main() {
    const root = createRoot(document.getElementById("app"));
    root.render(<App />);
}

// Invoke the function that kicks off React!
main();
```

Pause and take a look at what you just did.


### 3.2. Import Components

### App.js
Add some import statements!
```jsx
```

## 4. What to Turn In
Please create a pull request with the fully implemented web client (which should be completed inside of your version of your `lab05` folder).
