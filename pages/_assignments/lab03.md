## Learning Goals
### JavaScript
* Helping students get acquainted with JavaScript
* Setting up npm, mocha, etc.

### TDD
* Write a failing test first.
* Then implement the feature that fixes the failing test.
* Think about the kinds of things you want to test for (missing data, wrong data types, data out of range).

### Software Construction
* Introduce functional programming
* Introduce the idea of good API design. What's the right level of abstraction?
