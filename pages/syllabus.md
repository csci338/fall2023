## About the Course
TODO.

## Course Format
The course format includes a mix of assigned readings, lectures, labs, and homework. We will generally try to use our Tuesday class time to discuss a "big idea" in software engineering, and our Thursday class time to complete hands-on labs. It is your responsibility to keep up-to-date on class material and announcements, as the schedule is subject to change. This includes material presented and announcements made in class, via email, or on Moodle.

### Class Participation
Class meetings will be in person. Most class sessions have accompanying readings, which you will be expected to complete before class. Please do your best to be physically and mentally present, and to share your knowledge and experience with one another. 

### Homework
Over the course of the semester, you will be working with your classmates on a collaborative software development project. During the first half of the semester, you will be assigned 1-2 features that you will need to implement and deploy to the class's shared codebase. During the second half of the semester, you will be working with one or more of your classmates to design, build, and test a feature that you come up with as a team. 

Our hope is that the experience will help you develop more perspective around how software teams organize their work, make decisions, onboard new developers, introduce new features, etc.

### Labs
Labs are intended to be completed during class on Thursdays (unless otherwise specified), so that we can help you with any questions (or configuration issues) you make have. Each lab is designed to give you practice with a tool, technique, or workflow relevant to building collaborative software.

### Code Reviews
Should we say something about how code reviews will work?

## Course Expectations
* You will come to class prepared and ready to engage in an intellectual discussion about the readings.
* You will complete all assignments on time and with interest, engagement, and intellectual curiosity.
* You will bring your unique expertise, perspectives, and experiences to class and share them with others, so that we might all gain from your perspectives.
* You will respect and seek to understand the unique perspectives and experiences of others.
* You will give your classmates the benefit of the doubt (about their competence and intentions) and can expect the same from them.
* All work that you submit will be your own original work; you will cite others’ work where appropriate.

## Course Materials & Resources

### Software
As this is a programming course, you will be installing and configuring many free software programs, including the ones listed below. This software will probably require between 3-5GB of space on your hard drive. Installing and configuring programming software can be a hassle, but it is part of the process of developing your working computing knowledge. We will help you.

* <a href="https://github.com/git-guides/install-git" target="_blank">Git and the Github Client</a>

### Book
* We will be reading selected chapters from <a href="https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book" target="_blank">Software Engineering at Google</a>. There is a free copy of the book online, or you can order a hardcopy book. 

### Acknowledgements
These course materials were developed collaboratively by Sarah Van Wart and Semmy Purewal.

## Grading
Your course grade is calculated based on homework, labs, and attendance / participation:

{:.small}
| **Labs** | 40% |
| **Homeworks** | 40% |
| **Attendance & Participation** | 20% |

### Labs
Labs will be graded according to the following scale (from 0-3 points):

| 0pts | Not attempted | Assignment not submitted. |
| 1pt | Check Minus | Assignment attempted but less than half of it was completed correctly. |
| 2pts | Check | Most of the assignment was completed; works as expected. |
| 3pts | Check Plus | assignment completed. Works as expected. |

**Late labs will not be accepted.**

### Homework
There will be roughly 6 homework assignments. Homework will be graded pass / fail. The workflow is as follows:
1. You will submit your homework as a pull request (PR) on or before the due date.
1. We will do a code review and either ask for changes or accept your changes. 
    * If your PR is accepted, you're done.
    * Otherwise, you will need to implement the requested changes and re-submit (which will initiate another code review cycle).
 
Questions: 
* What do w/late submissions?
* How long should we give students to address / fix their code?

### Participation
In this class, participation is defined as:

1. [10%] Attendance – "Half of life is just showing up."
2. [10%] Engaging with the course ideas and with your peers, including completing the readings and participating in the discussions and activities.

We will take attendance. You may miss **two** class sessions – no questions asked – without a grade penalty. Any additional absences (beyond your two “freebies”) will impact your participation grade (and more to the point, your capacity to productively engage with the class).


## Course Policies

### General
* No food, no drinks, and no water inside the classroom. If you need to eat or drink, please step outside the classroom (away from the computers) to do so.
* Be respectful of others during classroom discussions and presentations.
* We may have the occasional remote class session.

### Academic Honesty
In the past, there have been a few unfortunate instances in which students have presented work other than their own. Here are some guidelines to help you understand what is and is not appropriate. Please do no hesitate to contact the instructors if you have any questions about these guidelines.

#### Labs
Helping other students with their in-class labs is allowed and encouraged, but each student should type their own solution unless otherwise specified in the lab instructions.

#### Homework
* You are allowed and encouraged to discuss general approaches to solving problems, but all work you submit must be your own (no "outsourcing").
* Uploading materials from this course to websites that sell such content to students is prohibited by UNCA’s academic integrity policies, and may also put you at risk for violating copyright policies in UNCA’s Student Conduct Code.

#### Using Outside Tools and Materials
In this class, we encourage you to explore the broader Internet for tutorials, code samples, new coding techniques, libraries, etc. That said, you must *acknowledge all sources contributing to your work.*  If you receive any assistance from any source (Internet, peer, social media, ChatGPT, etc.), please describe your source and that source’s contribution(s). If you have any questions about this, please don't hesitate to contact me.

Students violating the academic honesty policy on an assignment will receive a grade of 0 on that assignment for the first offense, and will receive a grade of "F" in the course for the second offense. This will apply to all students involved in the violation, including both the source student and the copying student. It is your responsibility to ensure that your work is not used by other students.

All cases of academic dishonesty will be reported to the Assistant Provost.


### Class Cancellation Policy
If a class meeting is canceled or due dates are moved due to inclement weather or any other reason, we will inform you via campus email (ending with unca.edu).



## University Policies

### Office of Academic Accessibility 
UNC-Asheville values the diversity of our student body as a strength and a critical component of our dynamic community. Students with disabilities or temporary injuries/conditions may require accommodations due to barriers in the structure of facilities, course design, technology used for curricular purposes, or other campus resources. Students who experience a barrier to full access to this class should let the professor know, and/or make an appointment to meet with the Office of Academic Accessibility as soon as possible. To make an appointment, call 828.232.5050; email academicaccess@unca.edu; visit [https://oaa.unca.edu/](https://oaa.unca.edu/) and click on "Schedule an Appointment"; or drop by the Academic Accessibility Office, room 008 in the One Stop suite (lower level of Ramsey Library). Learn more about the process of registering, and the services available through the Office of Academic Accessibility here: [https://oaa.unca.edu/](https://oaa.unca.edu/)

While students may disclose disability at any point in the semester, students who receive Letters of Accommodation are strongly encouraged to request, obtain and present these to their professors as early in the semester as possible so that accommodations can be made in a timely manner. It is the student’s responsibility to follow this process each semester.

### Promoting Gender Equity, Addressing Sexual Misconduct
UNC Asheville is dedicated to cultivating and maintaining a safe, respectful, and inclusive environment, free from harassment and discrimination. We strive to ensure that all have equal access to the educational and employment opportunities the University provides. If you or someone you know has been affected by sexual misconduct, including sexual or gender-based harassment, sexual assault, dating or domestic violence, or stalking, please know that help and support are available. UNC Asheville strongly encourages all members of the community to take action, seek support, and report incidents of sexual harassment to the Title IX Office. You may contact the Title IX Office or Heather Lindkvist, the Title IX Coordinator, directly at 828.232.5658 or at titleix@unca.edu. Learn more by visiting [titleix.unca.edu](https://titleix.unca.edu).

As a faculty member, we are “responsible employees,” meaning that if you share any information or discuss an incident with us regarding sexual or gender-based harassment, we must disclose this information to the Title IX Coordinator. Our goal is to ensure you are aware of the range of options available to you and have access to the resources you may need. 

If you wish to speak with a confidential resource, contact University Health and Counseling Services at 828.251.6520. Off-campus confidential resources include Our Voice (24-Hour Hotline at 828.255.7576) and HelpMate (24-Hour Hotline at 828.254.0516).

### Academic Indicators
Faculty at UNC Asheville are required to use the university's Academic Indicators system. The purpose of this system is to communicate with students about their progress in courses. Academic Indicators can reflect that a student’s performance is satisfactory at the time it is submitted, or they can indicate concerns (e.g., academic difficulty, attendance problems, or other concerns). Professors use this system because they are invested in student success and want to encourage open conversations about how students can improve their performance. When a faculty member submits an indicator that expresses a concern, the student receives an email from Academic Advising notifying them of the indicator and subsequent registration hold on their account. To clear the hold, the student must complete an online Response Form included in the alert e-mail. 

The student’s responses will be shared with the instructor and advising staff. If a student receives three or more indicators that show problems, they will need to meet with an advisor by scheduling an appointment using the online appointment service at [advising.unca.edu](https://advising.unca.edu/) and select ‘Academic Alert Appointment’ as the type of appointment. The professor may also request to meet with the student to discuss the indicator.  It is in the student's best interest to complete the process quickly, as students who do so are more likely to earn credit for the course. Failure to complete the process means the student won't be able to register for the next semester's classes until they have submitted the required form and completed any requested meeting requirements. Questions about the indicator system can be directed to Anne Marie Roberts (amrober1@unca.edu) in the [Academic Success Center](https://www.unca.edu/academics/academic-success/).

### Mental Health Support
As a student, you may experience a range of challenges that can interfere with learning, such as stressful life events, experiences of anxiety and/or depression, self-harm, substance use, and/or unusual difficulty with ordinary life activities. The increased stress of school can also make existing mental health struggles more difficult to manage. Support is available and treatment can help. Learn more about the confidential mental health services UNC Asheville provides to support student success at [https://www.unca.edu/life/health-counseling/](https://www.unca.edu/life/health-counseling/)
