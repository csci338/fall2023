## Introduction
Welcome to your first CSCI 338 lab! The goal of today's lab is to get you a little more comfortable doing "configuration things," including working on the command line, configuring your command line environment, and working with command line code editors.

## Background & Reference Materials
This lab requires you to interpret and apply various online cheatsheets, tutorials, and configuration guides. We have curated a list of useful resources on the [course resources page](../resources/). See "The Command Line" and "Code Editors." 

> ## Outline
> Using the resources we have compiled for you, please complete the following tasks:
>
> 1. Install VS Code
> 2. Install the VS Code Extensions and ensure that they run
> 3. Complete the Command Line Exercises
> 4. Configure your command line environment using the `.zshrc` file (or `.bashrc` if you're running an older Mac OS)
> 5. Practice using either vim or emacs from the command line.

## 1. Install VS Code
Please install VS Code. When you're done, please install the following VS Code Extensions
* Live Server
* Language Extensions -- JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Python
* GitHub (handles the authentication for you so that you don't have to manage ssh public / private keys)
* Prettier

### Configuration Tasks
* [Configure "Format on Save" using Prettier](https://www.robinwieruch.de/how-to-use-prettier-vscode/) by modifying `settings.json` file (CTRL+, or CMD+,).
