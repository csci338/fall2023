For today's tutorial, you will get started on [HW4](hw04). Your job is to complete **at least 3** of the 7 tasks (and more if possible).

## What to Submit
To submit Tutorial 5, just link to at least three completed HW4 tasks from your homepage. See Sarah's homepage to see an example of what your homepage should look like:
* <a href="https://vanwars.github.io/csci185-coursework/" target="_blank">https://vanwars.github.io/csci185-coursework/</a>

When you're done, paste the following links into the Moodle under the Tutorial 5 submission section:

1. A link to your **homepage** on GitHub pages, which should link to at least 3 of the `hw04` tasks.
2. A link to your GitHub **code repository** (where your code files are stored).
