## Reference Materials
Please review the following reference materials before class:
1. [Video: Intro to Using VS Code Extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/extend)

## Activities 
Install VS Code

### 1. VS Code

#### Extensions to Install
* Live Server
* Language Extensions -- JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Python
* GitHub (handles the authentication for you so that you don't have to manage ssh public / private keys)
* Prettier

#### Configuration Tasks
* [Configure "Format on Save" using Prettier](https://www.robinwieruch.de/how-to-use-prettier-vscode/) by modifying `settings.json` file (CTRL+, or CMD+,).

### 2. Command Line Stuff


### 3. Vim / Emacs Activities
* Thoughts?
* Students will also need support w/command line. Clarity for Windows users? Powershell? DOS prompt? Something else?
  * Windows: **WSL Tutorial** (links)

Open EMACs, Get out of EMACs. Open VIM, get out of VIM.
  * Semmy Demo!
  * "dot files" (configuration stuff)

## What to turn in?
Nothing to turn in this week! Your lab grade will be based on participation.


## Notes from Semmy <> Sarah Meeting
* Code Editor – VS Code (strongly encouraged, but OK to also use emacs or vim).
Plugins
* Configurations
* How to create a plugin (interesting topic)
* A good thing to talk about – why it could be useful to also know vim and emacs (SSH).
* Configuring your environment is great to learn in college but no one teaches it.
* Don’t be scared of those configuration things.
* VS Code has this thing called “Language services” that helps you do do stuff.
